local?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are used to copy another repo on github. It is a kind of clone used only in github.
    clones are used to copy a remote repo to your computer. It is used to copy a remote repo locally.
    branches are seperate paths of commits in a repo. It is used to seperate master code from other versions of code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    git can use the copy to resolve conflicts between remote and local branches and also to make merges easy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Maybe i will use some sort of cloud storage or remote desktop. Git and github will be definitly easier.
